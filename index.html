            <p class="content">The navigationbar. It's one of the main components of a website. You use it to navigate
                through a website.
                now i can tell you it isn't that hard to make a navigation. But if u want visitors of your website to
                stay you need to style
                it. In this tutorial we will teach you how to make a vertical navigationbar. We will add some styling
                and animation also. In
                this tutorial a little javascript is used. But don't worry, all the code used is added to the tutorial
                so you can just
                copy & paste it into your code but i recommend doing a bit of research so you understand why we used it.
                If you find a mistake please let us know in the <a class="one" href="#comment">Comment</a> section.

                The foto's added below show the navigation bar without styling, with styling, and the animation.
                You can take a look at the navigation of this website, its the same ;)

        <!--HTML-->
        <a name="html"></a>
        <div style="margin-top: 10px;" class="divcontent">
            <h1 class="content">HTML</h1>
            <p class="content">Okay so i have explained to you what we are going to do. first-off you need your html
                file.
                Start a new file and save it as: "index.html"; a browser wil search for that file when your website is
                opened.
                If it's saved correctly open the file in your code editor. Most code editors have a html preset
                build-in. Me personally
                likes visual code from Microsoft. I'ts free and it offers alot plugins. If you want to make the base
                code yourself or youcant find
                out how to use the preset I will put a sample down here:
                <br>
                <br>
                <embed class="codepre" src="html1.txt">
                <br>
                <br>
                When you have made a basic page you can start adding the navigation. In the beginning it wont be a nice
                looking navigation.
                But dont worry, we will cover all that for you. You first make a button, in that button you put
                a hyperlink to your other pages.
                <br>
                <br>
                <embed class="codepre" src="html2.txt">
                <br>
                <br>
                You use the button element for creating a button, in the
                <!--button to css-->CSS section i will help you
                add styles to them. When you have made the buttons you can start adding hyperlinks.
                for this u use the < a href="#">. in the place of the hashtag u can put an URL or the path
                    to the page u want to open. between the < a>
                        < /a> you'll have to put the text that the button repersents.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <!--code div-->
                            Then u have < div>
                                < /div> tags. You can use the div tag to create what we call containers and because of
                                    these containers
                                    you are able to give diffrent scetions diffrent styles/scripts and it wont enteract
                                    with the any of the other sections on the webpage.


            </p>

        </div>


        <!--CSS-->
        <a name="css"></a>
        <div style="margin-top: 10px;" class="divcontent">
            <h1 class="content">CSS</h1>
            <p class="content">
                Ok so here is the section we explain to you CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) as the name suggests this is
                how you add style
                to the page. So to start off you will need to make a .css file and make sure it is in the same folder as
                the index.html
                after making the file you are ready to start. Now because this is a tutorial about the navagationbar we
                arent going to show
                you all the css that he used only the important bits.
                <br>
                <br>
                First comes the
                <!--Add the code.html.png--> with this when you click the button of the section you want it doesn't
                instantly teleport instead it smoothly scrolles to the section.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now we are going to show you how we costumized the height, width, color and even position fo our
                navagationbar
                <!--Add the code.sidebar.png-->
                <br>
                <br>
                Now you have a navagationbar but thats not all you have to do now you need a way to gain access to the
                navagationbar
                and you do that with a open button the code for our open tab
                <!--Add the code.sidebar.openbtn.png-->
                <br>
                <br>
                But it would be pretty annoying if the navagationbar stayed there the whole time so you would also nned a close button
                <!--Add the code.sidebar.closebtn.png-->
                <br>
                <br>
                After you customize the navagationbar it is highly recommend to customize the buttons to
                in the display below we will show you how we went about it.
                <!--Add the code.sidebar.a.png-->
                <br>
                <br>
                You can also make a cool little hover animation like we have here by using the code in de the display
                below.
                <!--Add the code.sidebar.ahover.png-->
                <br>
                <br>
                Like we have on our wibsite you can put a gif or a picture if you want in your navagationbar to do that use the code supplied 
                in the display below<!--add the code.sidebar.vid.png-->
                <br>
                <br>
                We also have a small sample of text in our navagationbar to demostrate that you can have one in your navagtion bar if this also 
                peaks your interest you have to use the code in the display below<!--add code.sidebar.cont.png-->

            <p class="content">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
                printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not
                only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
                It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
                and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
                Ipsum.

                Why do we use it?
                It is a long established fact that a reader will be
                distracted by the readable content of a page when looking
                at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
                distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
                readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as
                their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their
                infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
                (injected humour and the like).</p>

                It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
                and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
                Ipsum.

                Why do we use it?
                It is a long established fact that a reader will be
                distracted by the readable content of a page when looking
                at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
                distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
                readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as
                their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their
                infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
                (injected humour and the like).</p>
