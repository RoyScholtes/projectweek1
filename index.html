            <p class="content">The navigationbar. It's one of the main components of a website. You use it to navigate thru a website. 
                now i can tell you it is'nt that hard to make a navigation. but if u want visitors of your website to stay u need to style 
                it. In this tutorial we will learn you how to make a vertical navigationbar. We will add some styling and animation. In 
                this tutorial a little javascript is used. But don't worry, all the code used is added to the tutorial so you can just 
                copy & paste it into your code.
                If you find a mistake please let us know in the <a class="one" href="#comment">Comment</a> section. <!--link naar comments-->

                <br>
                The foto's added below show the navigation bar without styling, width styling, and the animation.
                You can take a look at the navigation of this website, its the same ;)

            <h1 class="content">HTML</h1>
            <p class="content">Okay so i have explained to you what we are going to do. first-off you need your html file.
                Start a new file and save it as: "index.html"; a browser wil search for that file when your website is opened.
                If it's saved correctly open the file in your code editor. Most code editors have a html preset build-in. Me personally 
                likes visual code from Microsoft. I'ts free and it offers alot plugins. If you want to make the base code yourself or youcant find
                out how to use the preset I will put a sample down here:
                <br>
                <br>      
                <embed class="codepre" src="html1.txt">
                <br>
                <br>
                When you have made a basic page you can start adding the navigation. In the beginning it wont be a nice looking navigation.
                But dont worry, we will cover all that for you. You first make a button, in that button you put 
                a hyperlink to your other pages. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <embed class="codepre" src="html2.txt">
                <br>
                <br>
                you use the button element for creating a button, later on i will help you 
                creating a style for them. When you have made the buttons you can start adding hyperlinks.
                for this u use the < a href="#" >. in the place of the hashtag u kan put an URL or the path 
                to the page u want to open. between the < a > < /a > you can type the text wich u can see on
                the website.

            <p class="content">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
                printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not
                only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
                It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
                and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
                Ipsum.

                Why do we use it?
                It is a long established fact that a reader will be
                distracted by the readable content of a page when looking
                at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
                distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
                readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as
                their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their
                infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
                (injected humour and the like).</p>

            <p class="content">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
                printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not
                only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
                It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
                and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
                Ipsum.

                Why do we use it?
                It is a long established fact that a reader will be
                distracted by the readable content of a page when looking
                at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
                distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
                readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as
                their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their
